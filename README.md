# TAOtest

### A test of my abilities to join the JavaScript team at TAO.

I actually learned 80% of the tools I've used here from scratch, e.g. JQuery, Dialogs and so on.
I know these are outdated tools, and francly I would do it completly different in Angular 2 + ngrx, typescript or even ES5
Unfortunatly all of these require node.js and npm, which I don't have on my computer, and didn't want to wast time with installation

#### Please watch my other repositories and projects to get an idea of my knowledge and learning abilities.


p.s. the wirdly name file .fdproj is the project file of my ide FlashDevelop. For this project it was as functional as notepad++, but I do have an experience with WebStorm and Eclipse
